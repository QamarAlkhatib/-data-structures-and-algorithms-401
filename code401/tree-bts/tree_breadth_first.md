# Challenge Summary

Feature Tasks

    Write a function called breadth first
    Arguments: tree
    Return: list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered

    NOTE: Traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach


## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

Time complexity: O(n) : where n is the number of nodes in the tree

space: O(n): where n is the number of nodes in the tree

## Solution
