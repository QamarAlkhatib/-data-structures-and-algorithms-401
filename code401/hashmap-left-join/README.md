# Hashmap LEFT JOIN
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge

Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.

    Write a function called left join
    Arguments: two hash maps
        The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
        The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
    Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic

## Approach & Efficiency

Time: O(n) where n is the keys in the first hash table
