    breadth first
    Arguments: Node
    Return: A collection of nodes in the order they were visited.
    Display the collection

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

- Time: O(V+E) where V is a number of vertices in the graph and E is a number of edges in the graph.
- space: O(1)

## Solution

- [Code implementation](/code401/graph/graph/graph.py)
- [Test implementation](/code401/graph/tests/test_graph.py)
